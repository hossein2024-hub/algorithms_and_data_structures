    "This solution detects the first duplicate in a binary tree using a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** approach. It starts by checking if the tree is empty, returning `-1` if there is no root node. A **set (`seen`)** is used to track traveresed  values. A **queue** facilitates **level-order traversal**, where nodes are processed one by one. If a nodeâ€™s value is already in `seen`, it is immediately returned, ensuring that the closest-to-root duplicate is identified. Otherwise, the value is added to the set, and the nodeâ€™s left and right children are enqueued for further processing. If no duplicates are found, it returns `-1`."

    "- **Critique of the Provided Code Solution**\n",
    "The BFS-based solution correctly identifies the first duplicate value closest to the root. However, in my opinion, in terms o the implementation, using `queue.pop(0)` results in `O(N)` worst-case performance due to list shifting to delete the first item of the queue and then shift every elements to the left to fill the first index of the queue list. A `deque (collections.deque)` would be a better alternative for `O(1) popping` from the front. Otherwise, the solution is optimal in terms of correctness, clarity, and time complexity.\n",

    "In Assignment 1, I worked on finding all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree. I first used a **recursive DFS approach**, then suggested a **stack-based iterative method** in pseudocode. I also analyzed the **time and space complexity**, explaining how recursion naturally fits tree traversal to find all paths efficiently.  \n",

    "In Assignment 2, I reviewed a peerâ€™s **BFS-based solution** for detecting the first duplicate in a binary tree. Their approach used a **queue for level-order traversal**, ensuring the closest duplicate was found first. They also proposed **DFS** as an alternative solution, but I found a DFS does not guarantee finding the duplicate in level order because it explores a subtree fully before backtracking. I also noticed that their BFS implementation used **pop(0) on a list**, which is **O(N) due to shifting elements**. I suggested using **collections.deque.popleft()**, which is **O(1)** and much more efficient.  \n",
